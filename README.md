# GKS ASHG 2024 Unconference

Welcome to the repository for GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Unconference.

We will be hosting a unconference as an ancillary event at
[ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/meetings/2024meeting/) on Monday, November 4th, 2024 from
8 AM - 4 PM. The location is at the Hyatt Regency Denver at Colorado Convention Center
in room Mineral A. This repository will contain project proposals from registered
unconference participants.

## Participation Application and Selection

Due to the limited number of spaces, we require all interested participants to fill
out [this](https://forms.gle/DE7sMXLUCzHQhaJx6) application form. Only those who
complete the form will be eligible to participate. Please submit your application ASAP
to secure your spot.

To ensure meaningful collaboration, we will prioritize applicants who are committed to
making ongoing contributions or highly viable projects and tools that can scale and help
drive broader adoption of GKS products across the community.

**The application will close on Monday, October 14th at 8 AM EST.** Applicants will be
notified of the decision regarding their application via email by Friday, October 18th.
We look forward to your potential participation!

## Project Proposals

To propose a project, please submit your idea using our
[GitHub issue template](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-ashg-2024-unconference/issues/new?template=project-proposal.yaml).
We encourage you to submit your proposal ASAP so others have a time to review your
proposal before the event.

Check out the repository
[proposal tracker](https://github.com/ga4gh/gks-ashg-2024-unconference/issues)
and express your interest in proposed unconference projects with

on the top-level comment. If you want to see a proposed project clarified or otherwise
revised, add a comment to the issue and get a discussion going!

## Proposal Selection

Each proposal will have 1-2 minutes at the start of the unconference to give a brief
brief pitch. After the pitches, we will break off into smaller groups to focus on the
proposals that generate the most interest and engagement.
