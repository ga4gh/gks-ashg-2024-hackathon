Welcome to the repository for GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards (GKS) Hackathon.

We will be hosting a hackathon as an ancillary event at [ASHG](https://www.ashg.org/meetings/2024meeting/)
on Monday, November 4th, 2024. This repository will contain project proposals from 
registered hackathon participants. More details will be made available on this page 
closer to the event dates.

## Getting involved
